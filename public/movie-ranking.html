<hr />
<h3>Looper</h3>
<p>I love time travel movies. I watch many time travel movie but this one pick my attention and<br /> the plot twist was unexpected.</p>
<h3>Taken Movie Series</h3>
<p>I also love action movies. But Liam Neeson always do good action movies.<br />
I also recommend watching this movie.</p>
<h3>The Karate Kid (2010)</h3>
<p>I don't like bullies. I enjoy watching movies like this because in my childhood days,<br/>
I'm being bullied by other kids and I dont fight back. This movie shows how bullied kids fight back with no bad intentions.</p>
